🎚️ Extraction of Multiple Audio Features:
Extracted various features, including MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Centroid, Zero Crossing Rate, Spectral Rolloff, Tonnetz, Spectral Contrast, Pitch, and Jitter.

🔄 Normalization of Audio:
Normalized audio signals to ensure consistent data processing across different recordings.

🤖 Building, Training, and Evaluating Machine Learning Models:
Trained multiple models (including Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, ANN, and Bagging) to identify patterns and make predictions. Conducted model evaluations and optimizations.

🚀 Web Application with Flask:
Developed a user-friendly web application using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can record their voices, and the application provides predictions regarding Parkinson's disease based on the trained models.
