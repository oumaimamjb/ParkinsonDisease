🔍 Audio Loading and Visualization:
Loaded audio files from healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's disease. Visualized waveforms to get an overview.

🎶 Spectrogram Creation:
Generated spectrograms for better frequency representation in audio signals.

🔊 Noise Reduction using Median Filtering:
Applied median filtering to reduce noise in audio signals, enhancing the quality.

🎚️ Extraction of Multiple Audio Features:
Extracted various features, including MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Centroid, Zero Crossing Rate, Spectral Rolloff, Tonnetz, Spectral Contrast, Pitch, and Jitter.

🔄 Normalization of Audio:
Normalized audio signals to ensure consistent data processing across different recordings.

🤖 Building, Training, and Evaluating Machine Learning Models:
Trained multiple models (including Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, ANN, and Bagging) to identify patterns and make predictions. Conducted model evaluations and optimizations.

🚀 Web Application with Flask:
Developed a user-friendly web application using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can record their voices, and the application provides predictions regarding Parkinson's disease based on the trained models.
